            A simple definition of mental health is a person’s condition <br> with regard to their
             psychological and emotional well-being. <br> Mental health has an effect on each and every one of us. 
            <br> It determines how we as individuals interact with one another, <br> how we handle stressors in our lives, 
            how we handle <br> our own thoughts and emotions.

            Confidentiality and privacy in therapy.  When it comes to being in therapy, <br>
             patients have the right to feel heard, express their thoughts and <br>
             feelings without feeling judged. They also have the right to know that whatever information <br>
             is being shared will not be repeated outside of the therapist. <br>
             Specifically, for children, it becomes a different story in different ways. <br>
             Legally, a minor does not have the right to confidentiality in therapy from their parents. <br> 
             Although, children have the right to privacy from third parties, but not from their parents. <br>
             
            <br> The ethical complications with confidentiality with children are concerns with the circumstances <br>
            under which a therapist would disclose information that was shared by the child to their parents. <br>
            A therapist is legally obligated to report information shared by a child if he or she believes that <br>
            the child’s life is in danger. They are only allowed to share information that will be necessary to protect the child.
            <br> While there are laws with confidentiality, psychologists will only disclose information shared by the child to their <br>
            parents if it’s to protect the patient from harm, or to provide professional services. Patients that are underage should still <br>
            feel safe about disclosing information to their therapists and not have to worry about their parents knowing what was shared. <br>
             With this, therapists should inform them that any information that they shared would not always be kept from their parents, <br>
             but they could guide the parents or let them decide whether or not they want to know everything that had been discussed.
